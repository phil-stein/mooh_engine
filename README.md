## buggs
  - [ ] fix ale error on #include's
  - [ ] since mat sys blank.png gets loaded twice (hdr / no hdr) ? 
  - [ ] glfw mouse button & scroll callbacks 
    - works in nuklear, look at that
    - actually nuklear is stealing our callback from glfw
  - [ ] obj sizes are different than in blender
    - there is a apply transform option but its experimental
  - [ ] math_ivec2.h doesnt get included in terrain.c, maybe everywhere
  - [?] some shader sometimes buggs, my have been caused by the point below, weird matrices and such
  - [ ] terrain-chunks dont get culled properly 
  - [ ] point light entity *1* is not parented to the player, 
        but the player is it's parent
        aka. parenting is broken prob. in serialization
  - [ ] minimizing window to sys tray causes framebuffer crash [also mentioned here]()
  - [ ] freeing cubemap doesnt seem to actually free any memory

## optimizations
  - [ ] [multithreading](#multithreading) 
  - [ ] use textures with r = roughness, g = metallic, ...
  - [ ] change the white tex for no normal
  - [ ] occlusion culling 
  - [ ] batch renderer
  - [ ] lod system ?
  - [ ] octree or something for chunks, for entities / phys_objs
  - [ ] precompute brdf, etc., [also mentioned](#tools)
  - [x] custom asset formats
    - [x] mesh ~2.5x faster
      - pure verts, nothing else
      - 3:pos + 3:norm + 2:uv + 3:tan  =  11: f32, 44: bytes 
      - quad: fbx:11.1kb / custom:176bytes = 1.5% 
      - demon02: fbx:1.68mb / custom:87kb  = 5.1%
      - prob. not realistic to be this drastic, but say 10% would still be amazing
    - [x] texture ~10x faster
      - uncompressed for faster load time 
  - [ ] shader spir-v ?
  - [ ] custom asset archive files
    - all textures, etc. back to back in one file with a simple header
    - type specific or agnostic ?
      - i.e. just serialize a bunch of buffers or have mesh/texture
  - [ ] only clear outline buffer when deselecting
  - [ ] memory allocation optimization
    - [ ] read game engine architecture page 427-
    - [ ] stack allocator ?
    - [ ] frame allocator ?
    - [ ] pool allocator  ?
    - [ ] chunk allocator ?

## sus amogus
  - when parenting broke and i fixed it by setting 'is_moved' in 'state_update_global_model()'
    it worked before and something changed in the code that made it no longer work that way
    what exactly changed ???
  - ENTITY_SET_POS() doesnt work properly in program_sync_physics(), need to set velocity to 0
  - zip archive not faster than straight files

## organization
  - [ ] replace phys_act & scripts_act with flag
  - [ ] seperate save_sys.c into terrain & entities
  - [ ] use _dbg funcs for materials in assetm
  - [ ] implement glfw opengl debug context, learnopengl page 439
  - [ ] check shaders via reference compiler, page 444, debug_opengl.h
  - [ ] framebuffer debug, page 444, debug_opengl.h
  - [ ] add missing P_TYPE() funcs to global.h
  - [ ] add macro to print location in P(), PF(), P_TYPE(), etc. like in P_INFO(), in global.h
  - [ ] rename all stbd_ds arr, hm & sh vars to be f.e. world_arr, texture_idxs_sh, texture_data_hm, etc.
  - [ ] comment all .h files
    - [x] types
      - [x] mesh.h
       - [ ] check @TODO: in mesh_t 
    - [ ] main
      - [x] program.h
      - [x] renderer.h
      - [x] renderer_direct.h
      - [x] renderer_extra.h

      struct structure_def_t
      {
        entity_t* e;
        int parent_idx; // idx into structure_t, not world
