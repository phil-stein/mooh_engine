## buggs
  - [ ] glfw mouse button & scroll callbacks 
    - works in nuklear, look at that
    - actually nuklear is stealing our callback from glfw
  - [ ] obj sizes are different than in blender
    - there is a apply transform option but its experimental
  - [ ] math_ivec2.h doesnt get included in terrain.c, maybe everywhere
  - [?] some shader sometimes buggs, my have been caused by the point below, weird matrices and such
  - [ ] terrain-chunks dont get culled properly 
  - [ ] minimizing window to sys tray causes framebuffer crash [also mentioned here]()
  - [ ] freeing cubemap doesnt seem to actually free any memory
  - [ ] changing WINDOW_MIN, _MAX, _FULL doesnt work
  - [ ] changing THREAD_MAX in threadm.c doesnt affect its speed [also mentioned](#multithreading)

## optimizations
  - [ ] [multithreading](#multithreading) 
  - [ ] use textures with r = roughness, g = metallic, ...
  - [ ] change the white tex for no normal
  - [ ] occlusion culling 
  - [ ] batch renderer `WIP`
    - [x] keep track of draw calls 
    - [x] keep track of all template ents
    - [ ] mark static, in template / editor ?
    - [ ] instanced draw all static templates
  - [ ] lod system ?
  - [ ] octree or something for chunks, for entities / phys_objs
  - [ ] custom asset formats
    - [ ] cubemaps 
  - [ ] custom asset archive files | not in use
    - all textures, etc. back to back in one file with a simple header
    - type specific or agnostic ?
      - i.e. just serialize a bunch of buffers or have mesh/texture
    - screws with multithreading, kind of, also very big files
    - maybe just a couple at a time ?
    - [x] textures | not in use 
    - [ ] meshes
    - [ ] shaders
  - [ ] only clear outline buffer when deselecting
  - [ ] memory allocation optimization
    - [ ] read game engine architecture page 427-
    - [ ] stack allocator   ?
    - [ ] frame allocator   ?
    - [ ] pool allocator    ?
    - [ ] chunk allocator   ?
    - [ ] randy memory pool ?
  - [x] figure out why core_data_init() is taking so long: shaders
  - [ ] shader spir-v ?

## sus amogus
  - when parenting broke and i fixed it by setting 'is_moved' in 'state_update_global_model()'
    it worked before and something changed in the code that made it no longer work that way
    what exactly changed ???
  - ENTITY_SET_POS() doesnt work properly in program_sync_physics(), need to set velocity to 0
  - zip archive not faster than straight files

## organization
  - [ ] replace phys_act & scripts_act with flag
  - [ ] seperate save_sys.c into terrain & entities
  - [ ] implement glfw opengl debug context, learnopengl page 439 ?
  - [ ] check shaders via reference compiler, page 444, debug_opengl.h
  - [ ] framebuffer debug, page 444, debug_opengl.h
  - [ ] add missing P_TYPE() funcs to global.h
  - [ ] add icons to exe
    - [ ] texture_view
    - [ ] editor
  - [ ] make global submodule again, check if phys, serialization are still submodules
  - [ ] remove pos  maybe also cast_shadow, etc. from dir light
  - [ ] make most funcs _dbg error checked ? 
    - [ ] use _dbg funcs for materials in assetm ?
    - [x] make _dbg check a macro to set easy and compile out ?
      - when compiled out _file & _line cause errors
      - are _file & _line impacting performance ?
    - [ ] state
    - [ ] etc.
  - [ ] go through all files check for unecessary header includes, to lower compile time / remove clutter
  - [ ] comment all .h files
    - [ ] data
      - [ ] entity_template.h
      - [ ] material_template.h
      - [ ] shader_template.h

      - [ ] gizmo.h
      - [ ] gui.h

      struct structure_def_t
      {
        entity_t* e;
        int parent_idx; // idx into structure_t, not world
