## buggs
  - [ ] since mat sys blank.png gets loaded twice (hdr / no hdr) 
  - [ ] glfw mouse button & scroll callbacks 
    - works in nuklear, look at that
    - actually nuklear is stealing our callback from glfw
  - [ ] obj sizes are different than in blender
    - there is a apply transform option but its experimental
  - [ ] math_ivec2.h doesnt get included in terrain.c, maybe everywhere
  - [?] some shader sometimes buggs, my have been caused by the point below, weird matrices and such
  - [ ] deserializing scene sometimes adds pink point light infront of camera
  - [ ] terrain-chunks dont get culled properly 
  - [ ] point light entity *1* is not parented to the player, 
        but the player is it's parent
        aka. parenting is broken prob. in serialization
  - [ ] removing objects in editor causes crash
  - [ ] minimizing window to sys tray causes framebuffer crash [also mentioned here]()
  - [ ] serialization or something adds pointlights every u play 

## optimizations
  - [ ] [multithreading](#multithreading) 
  - [ ] use textures with r = roughness, g = metallic, ...
  - [ ] change the white tex for no normal
  - [ ] occlusion culling 
  - [ ] batch renderer
  - [ ] lod system ?
  - [ ] octree or something for chunks, for entities / phys_objs
  - [ ] precompute brdf, etc., [also mentioned](#tools)
  - [ ] custom asset formats
    - [ ] mesh
      - pure verts, nothing else
      - 3:pos + 3:norm + 2:uv + 3:tan  =  11: f32, 44: bytes 
      - quad: fbx:11.1kb / custom:176bytes = 1.5% 
      - demon02: fbx:1.68mb / custom:87kb  = 5.1%
      - prob. not realistic to be this drastic, but say 10% would still be amazing
    - [ ] texture ?
    - [ ] shader spir-v ?

## sus amogus
  - when parenting broke and i fixed it by setting 'is_moved' in 'state_update_global_model()'
    it worked before and something changed in the code that made it no longer work that way
    what exactly changed ???
  - ENTITY_SET_POS() doesnt work properly in program_sync_physics(), need to set velocity to 0

## organization
  - [ ] factor out cubemap creating from assetm, into sep. tool
  - [ ] factor out brdf creating from renderer, into sep. tool
  - [ ] fix ale error on #include's
  - [ ] replace phys_act & scripts_act with flag
  - [ ] seperate serialization.c into terrain & entities
  - [ ] comment all .h files in core
    - [ ] debug
      - [ ] debug_draw.h
      - [ ] debug_timer.h
    - [ ] types
      - [ ] framebuffer.h
      - [ ] material.h
      - [ ] mesh.h
      - [ ] shader.h
      - [ ] texture.h
      - [ ] types.h
    - [ ] main
      - [ ] assetm.h
      - [ ] camera.h
      - [ ] core_data.h
      - [ ] event_sys.h
      - [ ] file_io.h
      - [ ] input.h
      - [ ] program.h
      - [ ] renderer.h

      - [ ] state.h
      - [ ] str_util.h
      - [ ] terrain.h
      - [ ] window.h

## tools
  - [ ] binary dump
    - write empty scene, terrain, etc. to file

    - [x] blender coord sys to mine
  - [ ] asset manager
    - [ ] load shaders from zip
    - [ ] handle missing assets
    - [ ] custom asset formats [descr. here](#optimization)
  - [ ] structures (prefabs)
    ```c
      // this way structures can be added regardless of world id's
      // also entities need a reference to which structure they are a part of 
      struct structure_def_t
      {
        entity_t* e;
        int parent_idx; // idx into structure_t, not world
      };
      struct structure_t
      {
        structure_def_t* arr;
        int len;
      };
    ```
    - [ ] create / load

    - [ ] reset all dynamic objects ? 
      - this way we don't have to reload the entire thing 
      - not sure if needed in final game though
      - requires restructuring probably
      - reload suprisingly fast
    - [ ] game saves system
