## buggs
  - [ ] since mat sys blank.png gets loaded twice (hdr / no hdr) 
  - [ ] glfw mouse button & scroll callbacks 
    - works in nuklear, look at that
    - actually nuklear is stealing our callback from glfw
  - [ ] obj sizes are different than in blender
    - there is a apply transform option but its experimental
  - [ ] math_ivec2.h doesnt get included in terrain.c, maybe everywhere
  - [?] some shader sometimes buggs, my have been caused by the point below, weird matrices and such
  - [ ] deserializing scene sometimes adds pink point light infront of camera
  - [ ] terrain-chunks dont get culled properly 
  - [ ] point light entity *1* is not parented to the player, 
        but the player is it's parent
        aka. parenting is broken prob. in serialization
  - [ ] removing objects in editor causes crash
  - [ ] minimizing window to sys tray causes framebuffer crash [also mentioned here]()
  - [x] serialization or something adds pointlights every u play 
  - [x] play mode doesnt work anymore     
  - [x] deselecting doesnt clear the outline buffer
  - [ ] freeing cubemap doesnt seem to actually free any memory
  - [ ] brick material on groud isnt the same as the other cubes
    - they should all be referencing the same material_t 

## optimizations
  - [ ] [multithreading](#multithreading) 
  - [ ] use textures with r = roughness, g = metallic, ...
  - [ ] change the white tex for no normal
  - [ ] occlusion culling 
  - [ ] batch renderer
  - [ ] lod system ?
  - [ ] octree or something for chunks, for entities / phys_objs
  - [ ] precompute brdf, etc., [also mentioned](#tools)
  - [ ] custom asset formats
    - [ ] mesh
      - pure verts, nothing else
      - 3:pos + 3:norm + 2:uv + 3:tan  =  11: f32, 44: bytes 
      - quad: fbx:11.1kb / custom:176bytes = 1.5% 
      - demon02: fbx:1.68mb / custom:87kb  = 5.1%
      - prob. not realistic to be this drastic, but say 10% would still be amazing
    - [ ] texture ?
      - uncompressed for faster load time 
    - [ ] shader spir-v ?
  - [ ] only clear outline buffer when deselecting
  - [ ] change zip archive for custom file format
    - all textures, etc. back to back in one file with a simple header

## sus amogus
  - when parenting broke and i fixed it by setting 'is_moved' in 'state_update_global_model()'
    it worked before and something changed in the code that made it no longer work that way
    what exactly changed ???
  - ENTITY_SET_POS() doesnt work properly in program_sync_physics(), need to set velocity to 0
  - zip archive not faster than straight files

## organization
  - [x] factor out cubemap creating from assetm, into sep. file
  - [x] factor out brdf creating from renderer
  - [x] factor out mouse_pick & outline from renderer into sep. file 
  - [ ] fix ale error on #include's
  - [ ] replace phys_act & scripts_act with flag
  - [ ] seperate save_sys.c into terrain & entities
  - [ ] use _dbg funcs for materials in assetm
  - [x] change idx to id in state / entity / etc.
  - [x] ! get game comliling again
  - [x] make serialization into generalized gitrepo
    - [x] seperate serialization & save_sys 
  - [ ] comment all .h files in core

      {
        entity_t* e;
        int parent_idx; // idx into structure_t, not world
