## the jist 
mixture between *slime rancher* and *my time at portia*, maybe also *zumbie blocks*.
the game will revolve around building up a base / farm and going out to explore / do quests and maybe go to town.
exploring / going to town can give the player special items, crops, etc.
vs.
basically *slime rancher*, top-down or fps, but leaving the base means combat encounters and maybe npc's.


## the base / farm
the base will be where the player will farm and craft, certain things only craftable in f.e. a crafting bench.
the gameplay will be that the player grows crops to gain money, maybe raise animals.
the other motivator for growing crops & quests is that they yield unique items.
the starting crops are available in the town / already in inventory / shop.
the more advanced plants must be earned via exploration and quests.

## exploration
leaving the base to go through the world the player can look for new crops, maybe combat, etc.
*small* open world, maybe with possibilities to enter sub-levels, like caves, houses, etc.

## combat
?

## the town
town with shop, quests, etc. 
usure if this is do-able

## the artstyle
stylized pbr, like overwatch, maybe with a bit of an handpainted look.
