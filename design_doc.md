## the jist 
### old
mixture between *slime rancher* and *my time at portia*, and potentially some roque-like stuff
the game will revolve around building up a base / farm and going out to explore / do quests and maybe go to town.
exploring / going to town can give the player special items, crops, etc.
vs.
basically *slime rancher*, top-down or fps, but leaving the base means combat encounters and maybe npc's.

### new
*slime rancher* inspired, with more npc charachters and combat
you leave the base to explore and find new animals, crops, upgrades to bring to the base, while doing this
you may encounter enemies with stealth beeing a good option, as combat might be difficult
you have a secure base and venture out into the hostile map, sectmented into different sections like possible [these](#map sections)
bosting different livestock, crops and equipment according to the theme
some regions are more filled with robots than others, some are borderline impossible to fight through so stealth is the best option

## movement
inspired mainly by *roboquest*, with relatively fast walk and sprint speeds and a slide

## the base / farm
the base will be where the player will farm and craft, certain things only craftable in f.e. a crafting bench.
the gameplay will be that the player grows crops to gain money, maybe raise animals.
the other motivator for growing crops & quests is that they yield unique items.
the starting crops are available in the town / already in inventory / shop.
the more advanced plants must be earned via exploration and quests.

## exploration
leaving the base to go through the world the player can look for new crops, maybe combat, etc.
*small* open world, maybe with possibilities to enter sub-levels, like caves, houses, etc.

## combat
movement shooter,  

## the town
town with shop, quests, interactable npc's with storylines etc. 
usure if this is do-able

## cave / tunnels / roque-like
maybe have cases, tunnels, robo-camps, etc. as roque-like areas for farming loot,
if not as roque-like elements, more like far-cry where they can be conquered, maybe clearing the area of robots

## the artstyle
stylized pbr, like overwatch, maybe with a bit of an handpainted look.

## the story
after returning to earth / going there for the first time, you arrive at the piece of land you bought and start farming, 
as was your plan for a calmer life. you start reach the limit of things do-able with the equipment, crops & livestock 
already present on the farm, so you start to explore. you find other settlers, but they're extremely weary of you, 
so for now you move further, this leads you to find out that earth is colonized by robots, 
and they do not like you. so to expand your base / farm and fight back you gather equipment, livestock & crops and 
embark to take down the central server for your region.
on this journey you every now and then find other survivors and gain their trust to here the story they have to tell.
piecing these fragments together you learn what really happened.
what really happened ...
